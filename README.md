# Contact Support Animation

##### Why to show an animation to sending an email?

Most of us miss to attract the users of our app to cool them before the bring issues to our support desk. This would be important for the developers/organization to pacify the customers and get the correct level of info for helping them to assist. Showing a good animation would have a little impact to cool the users.

##### How to Use?

Very simple - Have a "Contact Support Button" in your activity and click listener to call the following call:

```java
startActivity(new Intent(YourActivity.this,EnvelopeActivity.class));
```
